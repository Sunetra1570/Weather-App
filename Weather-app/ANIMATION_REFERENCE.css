*/

/* ============= CUSTOMIZATION TIPS ============= */
/*
   To modify animations:
   
   1. Speed: Change duration values (e.g., 2s → 4s)
   2. Delay: Adjust animation-delay values
   3. Distance: Modify translate values
   4. Intensity: Change scale/rotate amounts
   5. Smoothness: Update timing functions
   6. Disable: Set animation: none
   
   Example:
   .my-element {
       animation: myAnimation 2s ease-in-out 0.5s infinite;
                  ↑           ↑   ↑          ↑    ↑
              name    duration timing   delay  mode
   }
